# Functional Programming with Javascript 

### Big Picture
This is a Mars Dashboard that consumes the NASA API and demonstrates functional javascript programming concepts using the ImmutableJS library.
It fetches information about three Mars Rovers in a reusable way and stores the data in an immutable state on the client side. 
Furthermore, it also fetches an astronomical photo of the data endpoint and also stores the data in an immutable state on the client side.
The goal is for the end user to be able to easily navigate between these various rovers and photo of the day and display important information about them.
